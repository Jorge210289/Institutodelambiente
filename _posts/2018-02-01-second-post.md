All blog post files must begin with YAML Front Matter. After that, itâ€™s simply a matter of deciding which format you prefer. Jekyll supports Markdown out of the box, and has myriad extensions for other formats as well, including the popular Textile format. These formats each have their own way of marking up different types of content within a post, so you should familiarize yourself with these formats and decide which one best suits your needs.
